# 🎉 reCAPTCHA v3 Implementation Complete!

## Overview
Your forms are now protected with Google reCAPTCHA v3 with a **0.9 minimum score threshold** - one of the most secure settings available.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Protection (Forms)
**Files:** `components/new/request-form.jsx` & `components/new/request-form-hero.jsx`

- ✅ Automatic token generation on form submission
- ✅ Smart loading state ("Loading security check..." until ready)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages if verification fails
- ✅ reCAPTCHA legal notice (required by Google)
- ✅ Action name: `submit_form`

### 2. Server-Side Verification (API)
**File:** `pages/api/sendinfo.js`

- ✅ Token verification with Google's API
- ✅ Score threshold: **≥ 0.9** (very strict)
- ✅ Action verification: Must match `submit_form`
- ✅ Helpful error responses
- ✅ Score logging for monitoring

### 3. Verification Utility
**File:** `lib/recaptcha.js`

- ✅ Reusable verification function
- ✅ Configurable minimum score
- ✅ Action name validation
- ✅ Detailed error reporting
- ✅ Google API integration

### 4. Global Integration
**File:** `pages/_document.js`

- ✅ reCAPTCHA script loaded on all pages
- ✅ Uses environment variable for site key
- ✅ Non-blocking, loads after page interaction

### 5. Visual Improvements
**File:** `styles/globals.css`

- ✅ Hidden default reCAPTCHA badge (we show our own legal notice)

## 🔑 NEXT STEPS - Required to Activate

### Step 1: Get Your reCAPTCHA Keys (5 minutes)

1. Visit: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
2. Click the **+** button to register a new site
3. Fill in:
   - **Label**: "Lupo Dumpster Website"
   - **Type**: Select **reCAPTCHA v3** (important!)
   - **Domains**: 
     - `localhost` (for testing)
     - Your production domain (e.g., `lupodumpsterrentals.com`)
4. Click Submit
5. Copy both keys shown on the next screen

### Step 2: Add Keys to Environment Variables

Create or update `.env.local` in your project root:

```bash
# Google reCAPTCHA v3 Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=6LxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxG
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=6LxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxG
```

**Important:** Replace the example keys with your actual keys!

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Form

1. Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
2. Scroll to the form
3. The button should say "Get My FREE Quote Now →" (not "Loading...")
4. Fill out the form with test data
5. Submit and verify it works!

## 🎯 What Happens Now

### For Legitimate Users (Score ≥ 0.9):
1. User fills out form
2. reCAPTCHA analyzes behavior in the background
3. Token generated on submit (score: 0.9-1.0)
4. Form submits successfully
5. User redirected to thank-you page

### For Suspicious Activity (Score < 0.9):
1. User fills out form
2. reCAPTCHA detects suspicious behavior
3. Token generated on submit (score: 0.0-0.89)
4. Server rejects submission
5. User sees error: "Security verification failed. Please try again or contact us directly at (727) 317-6717."

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### View reCAPTCHA Dashboard:
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin

You'll see:
- **Request volume** over time
- **Score distribution** (how many users at each score level)
- **Actions** breakdown (all will be `submit_form`)
- **Verifications** that passed/failed

### Server Logs:
Look for these messages in your server logs:
- ✅ Success: `reCAPTCHA verified successfully with score: 0.95`
- ❌ Failure: `reCAPTCHA verification failed: Score 0.7 is below minimum threshold 0.9`

---

## 🔧 Adjusting the Threshold

The default is **0.9** (very strict). You can adjust based on your needs:

**Edit:** `pages/api/sendinfo.js` around line 40-44

```javascript
const recaptchaResult = await verifyRecaptcha(
  recaptchaToken,
  "submit_form",
  0.9  // ← Change this value
);
```

**Recommended values:**
- `0.9` - Very strict (current) - Blocks most bots, may block some edge cases
- `0.7` - Strict - Good balance of security and usability
- `0.5` - Moderate (Google's default) - Catches obvious bots
- `0.3` - Lenient - Only blocks very obvious bots

**Best practice:** Start at 0.9, monitor for a week, then adjust if you see false positives.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Button Stuck on "Loading security check..."

**Causes:**
- Site key not set or incorrect
- Site key is for reCAPTCHA v2 (not v3)
- Dev server not restarted after adding env vars

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
2. Verify key is from a reCAPTCHA **v3** site
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Check browser console for errors

---

### Issue: All Form Submissions Blocked

**Causes:**
- Secret key not set or incorrect
- Keys are from different reCAPTCHA sites
- Domain not registered in reCAPTCHA admin
- Threshold too high (0.9 is very strict)

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.env.local` has `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`
2. Verify both keys are from the **same** reCAPTCHA site
3. Add your domain in reCAPTCHA admin → Settings → Domains
4. Try lowering threshold to 0.7 temporarily
5. Check server logs for error details

---

### Issue: No reCAPTCHA Verification Happening

**Causes:**
- Secret key not set in production
- Token not being sent from client
- Server error during verification

**Solutions:**
1. Add `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` to production environment variables
2. Check browser Network tab - request should include `recaptchaToken`
3. Check server logs for verification errors
4. Verify `lib/recaptcha.js` is being imported correctly

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Before Deploying:

1. ✅ Add your production domain to reCAPTCHA admin
   - Go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
   - Click your site → Settings → Domains
   - Add domain (without http:// or https://)

2. ✅ Add environment variables to your hosting platform:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
   - `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`

3. ✅ Test in production after deployment

### Platform-Specific Instructions:

**Vercel:**
1. Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add both variables
3. Redeploy

**Netlify:**
1. Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add both variables
3. Trigger new deploy

**Other Platforms:**
1. Find environment variables section
2. Add both variables
3. Redeploy/restart

## 🎓 Understanding the Score

reCAPTCHA v3 returns a score from 0.0 to 1.0:

| Score Range | Meaning | Your Action |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 0.9 - 1.0 | Very likely legitimate | ✅ Allow (current threshold) |
| 0.7 - 0.9 | Probably legitimate | ❌ Block (could lower threshold) |
| 0.5 - 0.7 | Neutral/Uncertain | ❌ Block |
| 0.3 - 0.5 | Probably suspicious | ❌ Block |
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Very likely bot | ❌ Block |

**Your current setting (0.9):**
- Very strict security
- Excellent bot protection
- May occasionally block legitimate users in edge cases
- Monitor analytics and adjust if needed
